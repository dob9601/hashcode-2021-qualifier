 - GeneticSolver: A genetic algorithm approach for solving hashcode
 - ActiveStreetSolver: A simple solver that sets the traffic light timings to be even on all streets with cars traveling on them at some point
 - BusiestPrioritySolver: Same as the ActiveStreetSolver but weighted towards streets with more cars.
